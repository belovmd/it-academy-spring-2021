An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it,

The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]

Your function should return the int 5.

""" Third task

Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer.
You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each decimal digit of the number to be encoded separately, 
starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any 0s. So 1990 is rendered "MCMXC" (1000 = M, 900 = CM, 90 = XC) and 
2008 is rendered "MMVIII" (2000 = MM, 8 = VIII). The Roman numeral for 1666, "MDCLXVI", 
uses each letter in descending order.

Example:

solution('XXI') # should return 21

"""Fifth task
Let us consider this example (array written in general format):

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

Its following parts:

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [3, 6, 10]
ls = [6, 10]
ls = [10]
ls = []
The corresponding sums are (put together in a list): [20, 20, 19, 16, 10, 0]

The function parts_sums (or its variants in other languages) will take as parameter a list ls and return a list of the 
sums of its parts as defined above.

Other Examples:
ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
