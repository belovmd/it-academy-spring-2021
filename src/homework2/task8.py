""" Second task
An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it,
then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

Example:

The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]

Your function should return the int 5.

If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it,
your function should return the int 0.

Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be [])."""

Given a string, turn each character into its ASCII character code
and join them together to create a number - let's call this number total1:

'ABC' --> 'A' = 65, 'B' = 66, 'C' = 67 --> 656667

total1 = 656667

total2 = 656661

""" Third task

Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value
as a numeric decimal integer.
You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each decimal digit of the number
to be encoded separately, starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any 0s.
So 1990 is rendered "MCMXC" (1000 = M, 900 = CM, 90 = XC) and
2008 is rendered "MMVIII" (2000 = MM, 8 = VIII). The Roman numeral for 1666, "MDCLXVI",
uses each letter in descending order.

Example:

solution('XXI') # should return 21

"""Fifth task
Let us consider this example (array written in general format):

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

Its following parts:

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [3, 6, 10]
ls = [6, 10]
ls = [10]
ls = []
The corresponding sums are (put together in a list): [20, 20, 19, 16, 10, 0]

The function parts_sums (or its variants in other languages) will take
as parameter a list ls and return a list of the sums of its parts as defined above.

Other Examples:
ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
parts_sums(ls) -> [21, 20, 18, 15, 11, 6, 0]

ls = [744125, 935, 407, 454, 430, 90, 144, 6710213, 889, 810, 2579358]

"""A friend of mine takes the sequence of all numbers from 1 to n (where n > 0).
Within that sequence, he chooses two numbers, a and b.
He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence,
excluding a and b.
Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
The function takes the parameter: n (n is always strictly greater than 0)
and returns an array or a string (depending on the language) of the form:

[(a, b), ...] or [[a, b], ...] or {{a, b}, ...} or or [{a, b}, ...]
with all (a, b) which are the possible removed numbers in the sequence 1 to n.

[(a, b), ...] or [[a, b], ...] or {{a, b}, ...} or ... will be sorted in increasing order
of the "a".

It happens that there are several possible (a, b). The function returns an empty array
(or an empty string) if
no possible numbers are found which will prove that my friend has not told the truth!
(Go: in this case return nil).

Examples:
removNb(26) should return [(15, 21), (21, 15)]
or
removNb(26) should return { {15, 21}, {21, 15} }
or
removeNb(26) should return [[15, 21], [21, 15]]
or
removNb(26) should return [ {15, 21}, {21, 15} ]
or
removNb(26) should return "15 21, 21 15"

"""Given two strings s1 and s2, we want to visualize how different the two strings are.
We will only take into account the lowercase letters (a to z).
First let us count the frequency of each lowercase letters in s1 and s2.
s1 = "A aaaa bb c"
s2 = "& aaa bbb c d"
s1 has 4 'a', 2 'b', 1 'c'
s2 has 3 'a', 3 'b', 1 'c', 1 'd'

So the maximum for 'a' in s1 and s2 is 4 from s1; the maximum for 'b' is 3 from s2.
In the following we will not consider letters when the maximum of their occurrences
is less than or equal to 1.

We can resume the differences between s1 and s2 in the following string: "1:aaaa/2:bbb"
where 1 in 1:aaaa stands for string s1 and aaaa because the maximum for a is 4.
In the same manner 2:bbb stands for string s2 and bbb because the maximum for b is 3.

The task is to produce a string in which each lowercase letters of s1 or s2 appears
as many times as its maximum if this maximum is strictly greater than 1;
these letters will be prefixed by the number of the string where they appear
with their maximum value and :. If the maximum is in s1 as well as in s2 the prefix is =:.

In the result, substrings (a substring is for example 2:nnnnn or 1:hhh;
it contains the prefix) will be in decreasing order of their length and when they have
the same length sorted in ascending lexicographic order (letters and digits - more precisely
sorted by codepoint); the different groups will be separated by '/'.
See examples and "Example Tests".

Hopefully other examples can make this clearer.
